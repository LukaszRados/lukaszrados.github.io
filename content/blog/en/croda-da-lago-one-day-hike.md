The loop has around 13km with 800m of elevation gain. We start early in the morning, after watching the sunrise from Passo Giau. The trailhead is located at Ponte de Ru Curto, with a small parking lot along the road. For the first hour it follows a forest trail where about half of the elevation for the day is done. Once we reach Lake Federa, we decide to go around counter-clockwise to enjoy the views and the reflections of the famous Becco di Mezzodì and the refuge. It is a popular spot among photographers (especially in autumn), but that day we have it mostly for ourselves. 

After eating an amazing Apfelstrudel in the refuge, we continue the route. Once we leave the refuge behind, the views open even more. The trail climbs gently towards Forcella Ambrizzola. There we do an almost 180 degree turn and continue on the other side of the Croda da Lago range. Once we reach Forcella Formin we stop for a bit to enjoy the views: everywhere we look, we see beautiful peaks. 

From there it’s all downhill. The route crosses a boulder field, but is really well marked and clearly visible. We have no problems with following it. As we go down, we see more and more people going up towards the lake. Going early in the morning is definitely a good decision.
