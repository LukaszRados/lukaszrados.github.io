intro: In the end of July I visited my friend who was working in CERN and living in beautiful village surrounded by vineyards. For the first time in my life I saw Alps and I immediately fell in love.

Although I wasn't on holiday â€“ I was working remotely for the whole week, I tried my best to see as much as possible. We visited Geneva several times, we went to the chocolate factory (can life be more perfect?) and we saw how gruyere cheese is made (and, unfortunately, we cannot unsee it). And most of all - we went to Chamonix and hiked to Lac Blanc which offers wonderful view of Mont Blanc.
