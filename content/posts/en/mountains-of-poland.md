title: 'Autumn and winter in the mountains of Poland'

intro: 'Once our one-year-long trip aboard s/y Moonshine was over I spent few months in Poland. Previous time I spent so much time at home was over four years ago - before I moved to the Netherlands. After four year I missed not only my family and friends, but also Polish mountains.'

When I moved to the Netherlands I knew that this country is known of many beautiful places: old towns of Amsterdam, Leida and Haarlem, windmills located by rivers and lakes, endless beaches on the coast of the North Sea. I knew, however, that it lacks mountains and I knew I am going to miss them. I kept tiring my friends with stories about the Netherlands being flat. 

Coming back to Poland I decided to spent some time in the mountains. I always carried my camera the backpack but sometimes there was no reason to take it out. The reason was the autumn and winter weather - volatile, full of rain and fog. But once the sun shines it's easy to fall in love with Tatras, Pieniny, Beskids and Karkonosze. Below I show a collection of photos taken recently.

During these three months in Poland I managed to go hiking 11 times and walk 160 km. Few of those were just quick trips for a sunrise or sunset while some were a full day long trips. Many of them ended up being miserable and bringing no photos but sometimes it was hard to stop taking photos. Most of all it was a great way to escape locked down cities.
