published_at: '2018-10-22'
intro: Last weekend we decided with Jola to go for a spontaneous trip to Ardennes in Belgium. We hoped to see beautiful autumn. Right after work we rented a car and hit the road and after only few hours we arrived to Bouillon.

Our plan was as follows: on Saturday we decided to do a full-day hiking and on Sunday nothing but chill. Bouillon is located by the river Semois. Although hills around are not very high, hikers can still choose a lot of uphill trails.

One of the most popular spots is a viewpoint with a view at The Giant's Tomb (fr. Le Tombeau du GÃ©ant). It is a small hill in the bend of the river, covered by trees that form a shape of a cross (as Internet claims, I think it's hardly visible).

Plan for Sunday was definitely more relaxed. I decided to shoot sunrise by the Tomb of the Giant, but when I arrived there everything was covered in the mist and there was absolutely no view. I did some driving trying to find nice compositions to picture this sunny, calm morning.
