With every photo I've seen (especially after Eyjafjallajökull erupted in 2010), with every article read and every timelapse video watched, I was falling more and more in love to this island. But strangely, for years I have postponed my trip. Deep inside I was worried that Iceland may turn out to be not as magical as I imagine (something like Paris syndrome) or weather will spoil my plans. Also, I was a bit afraid, that I will not be able to invent any new way to picture all the wonders of Iceland, both because of lack of skills and strong competition.","published_at":"2016-09-30","intro":"Hitchhiking on Iceland at the end of September? You guys are crazy! — Commented the first driver who gave us a lift. And yet, we did it – in 7 days with help of 28 wonderful drivers we traveled over 1150 km and we found that Iceland is as beautiful (and unpredictible at the same time) as it is described.","category":"photography","background":"v1620583043/stories/hitchhiking-in-iceland/45_k5ykj1.jpg","body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Visiting Iceland was my biggest dream since I saw some photos on 500px.com.
