In most of the european destinations it is already past the high season, which means less crowds and moderate weather. This year together with Jola we decided to fly to Tenerife. After few days there I dare to say that it's a landscape photographer's paradise.","category":"photography","background":"v1620582924/stories/canary-islands-tenerife/7_a2qayq.jpg","body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"We started our trip by doing small 'Tour de Tenerife' after which we got some idea which parts of island are interesting for us and which ones we would rather skip.

It's the island's highest point reaching 3718 meters. It looks really impressing especially when admired from the ocean level. Unfortunately to reach the peak you need to obtain a special permit which you need to do in advance via internet. As our trip was quite spontaneous and number of permits per day is limited, we didn't have a chance to do this. But we hope to come back soon."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"photo-lazy","props":{"padding":"66.666","src":"https://res.cloudinary.com/lukaszrados/image/upload/v1620582923/stories/canary-islands-tenerife/1_xinzap.jpg"},"children":[]},{"type":"element","tag":"photo-lazy","props":{"padding":"66.666","src":"https://res.cloudinary.com/lukaszrados/image/upload/v1620582923/stories/canary-islands-tenerife/2_ofcnkp.jpg"},"children":[]},{"type":"element","tag":"photo-lazy","props":{"padding":"66.666","src":"https://res.cloudinary.com/lukaszrados/image/upload/v1620582923/stories/canary-islands-tenerife/3_kbtv1z.jpg"},"children":[]},{"type":"element","tag":"photo-lazy","props":{"padding":"66.666","src":"https://res.cloudinary.com/lukaszrados/image/upload/v1620582924/stories/canary-islands-tenerife/4_xglstt.jpg"},"children":[]},{"type":"element","tag":"photo-lazy","props":{"padding":"66.666","src":"https://res.cloudinary.com/lukaszrados/image/upload/v1620582924/stories/canary-islands-tenerife/5_xvc37o.jpg"},"children":[]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Tenerife's climate is definitely worth a mention.
