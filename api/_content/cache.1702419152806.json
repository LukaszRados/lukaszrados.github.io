Z małpami tymi związana jest legenda głosząca, że kiedy magoty znikną z Gibraltaru, Brytyjczycy utracą tam swoje panowanie. Nic dziwnego więc, że traktują oni tę legendę poważnie. Na tyle poważnie, że do 1991 roku małpami opiekowało się wojsko, a obecnie dokarmianie ich przez turystów karane jest wysokimi karami pieniężnymi."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"photo-lazy","props":{"padding":"66.666","src":"https://res.cloudinary.com/lukaszrados/image/upload/v1663451002/stories/sailing-from-spain-to-morocco/271_bjjqkm.jpg"},"children":[]},{"type":"element","tag":"photo-lazy","props":{"padding":"66.666","src":"https://res.cloudinary.com/lukaszrados/image/upload/v1663451002/stories/sailing-from-spain-to-morocco/272_tcwge1.jpg"},"children":[]},{"type":"element","tag":"photo-lazy","props":{"padding":"66.666","src":"https://res.cloudinary.com/lukaszrados/image/upload/v1663451003/stories/sailing-from-spain-to-morocco/273_rimaem.jpg"},"children":[]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Patrząc na zdjęcia ciężko uwierzyć, że te małpki to prawdziwe diabły.
